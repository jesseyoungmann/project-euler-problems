# Project Euler problems in rust

I started as an excuse to keep learning Rust, and continued for the fun of optimizing the times way down after having done a bunch of these problems in Ruby.

To run them all, run `cargo mybench`.

It will print times for each and a list of the slowest problems.

The first 50 all together complete in under 1.5 seconds on my machine. (For reference, Project Euler says each problem should complete in under a minute.)

BigInt libraries feels vaguely like cheating for a couple of these problems, but Ruby gets that for free so why not.
